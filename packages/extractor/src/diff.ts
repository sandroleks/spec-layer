/**
 * diff.ts: the semantic diff behind the Library's "Review detected changes".

 * Pure and Figma-free. Two layers: a keyed-list core (diffKeyed) that the later
 * `spec-layer diff` command reuses with its own v5 keys, and group builders that
 * turn two hash projections into the ChangeGroup[] a Library row renders.
 *
 * The diff input is the hash input. componentChangeGroups takes two
 * SpecHashProjection values and foundationChangeGroups two FoundationUnitContent
 * values: exactly the objects specContentHash and foundationContentHash hash.
 * Comparing anything else could disagree with the "Update available" badge.
